# Diabetes_Predictor
Diabetes Predictor is a machine learning-based web application developed using Python and Flask to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user health inputs. The system was trained on the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset using multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Data preprocessing and feature scaling were implemented to improve model accuracy. The trained models were saved and integrated into a web interface that allows users to input health parameters and receive real-time prediction results.
